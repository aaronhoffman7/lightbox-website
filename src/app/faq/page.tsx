          <h2>Why are we a cooperative, not a nonprofit?</h2>
          <p>We believe in economic democracyâ€”having workers own and control a business together. We don&apos;t sell food and any money we receive goes back into labor, fun ingredients, and shared assets. Our co-op structure lets us build sustainable and circular economies rooted in collective wealth.</p>

          <h2>Where are we going from here?</h2>
          <p>We hope to expand the region&apos;s food sovereignty by providing ongoing food education programming that is inherently social and radical. We eventually hope to open a public kitchen lab and cafe + community, art, and urban ag space in DC. We want to connect big ideas to real lives through food.</p>
